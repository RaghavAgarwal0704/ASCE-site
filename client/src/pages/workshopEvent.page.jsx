                <p>
                    BIM or Building Information Modelling is a process that is a
                    collaboration of planning, designing, construction and
                    management of a project. All of the work is done in one
                    model, called the BIM model, that can be accessed and
                    updated across multiple interfaces throughout the lifetime
                    of the project. BIM software is what makes this possible by
                    3D design of the model and the data stored in it that helps
                    improve outcomes with its ability to investigate multiple
                    scenarios, providing data-driven assurance that projects can
                    be delivered on schedule and on budget. BIM is a staple in
                    the modern construction industry and this workshop conducted
                    by ASCE-VIT will help you stay caught up with the ever-
                    evolving world of BIM.

                    <h4>2. Modular and Nano housing</h4>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The workshop aims to impart knowledge on numerous aspects of
                    modular and nano housing. Modular and nano houses are built
                    on the idea of constructing the smallest possible
                    sustainable and eco-friendly houses. This pre-engineered
                    concept involves the use of sustainable architecture and
                    renewable energy systems for the creation of flexible
                    spaces. These houses can be used by a family of two or three
                    in an area of 25 square metres, incorporating the concept of
                    ‘suspending technology’. This helps in doubling the size of
                    the living area so that it can be used as two bedrooms at
                    night.The advantage of suspending technology is that it can
                    be used both in new constructions and also be incorporated
                    in existing structures. Thus, modular and nano housing
                    provides an optimistic and environmental solution for the
                    global housing issue of very small living spaces at
                    extremely high prices.

                    <h4>3. Self healing concrete</h4>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Infrastructure covers a very broad spectrum of materials.
                    Self-healing concrete provides a solution to high level
                    service and performance, high durability and minimum
                    negative ecological impact. The main focus of this workshop
                    is to explore the topic in-depth. Tiny cracks on the surface
                    of concrete structures makes the building vulnerable to
                    water seepage thus leading to degradation of concrete and
                    corrosion of steel reinforcement. This greatly reduces the
                    lifespan of a structure. This concrete was created by a
                    microbiologist who was inspired by the self-healing capacity
                    of bones. Self-healing of cracks in concrete would
                    contribute to a longer service life of concrete structures
                    and would make the material not only durable but also
                    sustainable. The self- healing agents can lie dormant within
                    the concrete for up to 200 years. The use of Bio concrete in
                    India is beneficial. The climate in India is diverse and
                    varies from region to region. The temperature change
                    deteriorates the concrete surface.
