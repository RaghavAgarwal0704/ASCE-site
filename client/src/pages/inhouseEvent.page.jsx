                    A quiz bowl conducted on the topics of structural
                    engineering, where participants come together and take a
                    challenge on the challenging questions, testing their
                    analytical ability and then followed by a lightning buzzer
                    round that engage participants with rapid fire questions and
                    answers and the ‘Unbreakable’ one takes it all.

                <p>
                    The event ace the space is to propagate usage of space
                    efficiently and effectively. The event will require the
                    participants to come up with a design for a Micro Home with
                    an area of not more than 25m2. The design should be planned
                    and scheduled using the PERT method only along with which a
                    rate estimate in detail is to be submitted. Regarding the
                    Micro Home, the structure must be that of a creative layout
                    that can accommodate a couple.

                    This event is designed in the sole interest of levelling up
                    the AutoCAD skills of the participants and then they are to
                    face each other on a battle royal, competing to produce the
                    perfect plan from the attained aesthetic and technical
                    knowledge about the software.

                    Paper presentations are a creative way to assemble
                    information on any topics and put them forward in the form
                    of a research paper. This event conducted by ASCE-VIT is a
                    brilliant opportunity to gain experience in writing a
                    research paper, the format and the methodology adopted for
                    the given topic. The participants will have a chance to
                    unleash their artistic side for the presentation of the
                    paper, as well as their curious nature is also satisfied
                    while digging up the content for the same. It truly is a
                    novel experience of immense use in the present and the
                    future too.
