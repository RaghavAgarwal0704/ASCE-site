                <p>A quiz bowl conducted on the topics of structural engineering, where participants
                    come together and take a challenge on the challenging questions, testing their analytical
                    ability and then followed by a lightning buzzer round that engage participants with rapid fire

                <p>The event ace the space is to propagate usage
                    of space efficiently and effectively. The event will require the participants to come up with a design for a Micro Home with an area of not
                    more than 25m2. The design should be planned and scheduled using the PERT
                    method only along with which a rate estimate in detail is to be submitted. Regarding the
                    Micro Home, the structure must be that of a creative layout that can accommodate a couple.</p>

                <p>This event is designed in the sole interest of levelling up the AutoCAD skills of the
                    participants and then they are to face each other on a battle royal, competing to produce
                    the perfect plan from the attained aesthetic and technical knowledge about the software.</p>

                <h2>4. Paper Presentation</h2>
                <p>Paper presentations are a creative way to
                    assemble information on any topics and put them forward in the form of a research paper.
                    This event conducted by ASCE-VIT is a brilliant opportunity to gain experience in writing a
                    research paper, the format and the methodology adopted for the given topic. The
                    participants will have a chance to unleash their artistic side for the presentation of the
                    paper, as well as their curious nature is also satisfied while digging up the content for the
                    same. It truly is a novel experience of immense use in the present and the future too.</p>
