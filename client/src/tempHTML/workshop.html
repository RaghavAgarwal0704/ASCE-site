                <h2>1. BIM</h2>
                <p>BIM or Building Information Modelling is a
                    process that is a collaboration of planning,
                    designing, construction and management of a
                    project. All of the work is done in one model,
                    called the BIM model, that can be accessed
                    and updated across multiple interfaces
                    throughout the lifetime of the project. BIM
                    software is what makes this possible by 3D
                    design of the model and the data stored in it
                    that helps improve outcomes with its ability
                    to investigate multiple scenarios, providing
                    data-driven assurance that projects can be
                    delivered on schedule and on budget. BIM is a
                    staple in the modern construction industry
                    and this workshop conducted by ASCE-VIT will
                    help you stay caught up with the ever-
                    evolving world of BIM.</p>

                <h2>2. Modular and Nano housing</h2>
                <p>The workshop aims to impart knowledge on
                    numerous aspects of modular and nano housing.
                    Modular and nano houses are built on the idea of
                    constructing the smallest possible sustainable and
                    eco-friendly houses. This pre-engineered concept
                    involves the use of sustainable architecture and
                    renewable energy systems for the creation of
                    flexible spaces. These houses can be used by a
                    family of two or three in an area of 25 square
                    metres, incorporating the concept of ‘suspending
                    technology’. This helps in doubling the size of the
                    living area so that it can be used as two bedrooms
                    at night.The advantage of suspending technology
                    is that it can be used both in new constructions
                    and also be incorporated in existing structures.
                    Thus, modular and nano housing provides an
                    optimistic and environmental solution for the global
                    housing issue of very small living spaces at
                    extremely high prices.</p>

                <h2>3. Self healing concrete</h2>
                <p>Infrastructure covers a very broad spectrum of
                    materials. Self-healing concrete provides a
                    solution to high level service and performance,
                    high durability and minimum negative ecological
                    impact. The main focus of this workshop is to
                    explore the topic in-depth. Tiny cracks on the
                    surface of concrete structures makes the building
                    vulnerable to water seepage thus leading to
                    degradation of concrete and corrosion of steel
                    reinforcement. This greatly reduces the lifespan of
                    a structure. This concrete was created by a
                    microbiologist who was inspired by the self-healing
                    capacity of bones. Self-healing of cracks in
                    concrete would contribute to a longer service life of
                    concrete structures and would make the material
                    not only durable but also sustainable. The self-
                    healing agents can lie dormant within the concrete
                    for up to 200 years. The use of Bio concrete in
                    India is beneficial. The climate in India is diverse
                    and varies from region to region. The temperature
                    change deteriorates the concrete surface.</p>
